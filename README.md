## note

If you use this program and you like it, spread the word around and give it credits! Implementing stuff that is already implemented can be a waste of time. And why don't you try to implement something that you like inside it? You will get for free MPI parallelization and variance calculation, that are already implemented in a very generic and abstracted way.

# Description


Features:

 - python interface (reads numpy array)
 - command line interface (reads binary lammps-like files)
 - multithreaded
 - command line interface has MPI too (for super-heavy calculations)
 - command line calculates variance of every quantity and every function (in python you can do it by yourselves with numpy.var )

Calculations:

- g of r ( and time too!)
- vibrational spectrum (this is nothing special)
- histogram of number of neighbours
- mean square displacement
- green kubo integral of currents
- multicomponent green kubo time domain formula (MPI here can be useful...)
- spherical harmonics number density time correlation analysis
- and more ...
- ...

# Building from source
Dependencies:

- C++17 capable compiler
- linux (mmap)
- FFTW3 (included in the package)
- Eigen3 (included in the package)
- Boost (included in the package)
- Mpi (optional)
- libxdrfile (for gromacs file conversion -- optional)
- python (optional) 

If you want to use system's fftw3 library, you have to provide to cmake the option:
```
-DSYSTEM_FFTW3=ON
```
If you don't want any python interface you have to provide to cmake the option:
```
-DPYTHON_INTERFACE=OFF
```

## MPI build (why not?)
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpicxx -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpicc -DUSE_MPI=ON
make
```
## non-MPI build (shame on you!)
```
mkdir build

## GreenKubo
 Given $M$ vector time series of length $N$ $^m \bf J _{t}$, $m\in\{1\dots M\}$, $t\in\{1\dots N\}$,
 implements an expression equivalent to the following formula:
 $$
 \begin{aligned}
 ^{ij}C_t &= \frac{1}{N_{ave}}\sum_{m=1}^{N_{ave}}\frac{1}{3}\sum_{c=1}^{3} \,^i\!J^c_m\cdot\,^j\!J^c_{m+l}\\
 ^{ij}L_t &= \left.\sum_{l=0}^{t}\right.^*\,^{ij}C_l \\
 ^{ij}\bar L_t &= \frac{1}{t}\left.\sum_{l=0}^{t}\right.^*\,^{ij}C_l\cdot l \\
 GK_t&=\frac{1}{^{0\,0}[(L_t)^{-1}]}\\
 \bar {GK}_t&=\frac{1}{^{0\,0}[(L_t-\bar L_t)^{-1}]}\\
 \end{aligned}
 $$
 but with the trapezoidal rule in place of the sums marked with $^*$. Note that $L_t$Â is a matrix. To get the correct units of measure, you have still to multiply all the quantities but the $C_t$s by the integration timestep. $N_{ave}$ is the number of timesteps on which the code runs the average.
 Every quantity is written in the output in the following order:
 $$\{^{0\,0}C_t,^{0\,0}L_t,^{0\,0}\bar L_t,^{0\,1}C_t,^{0\,1}L_t,^{0\,1}\bar L_t,\dots,^{M\,M}C_t,^{M\,M}L_t,^{M\,M}\bar L_t,GK_t,\bar {GK}_t\}$$
 If the command line tool is used, the variance of the block average is automatically computed, and after each column you find its variance. Moreover you find in the output a useful description of the columns with their indexes.

## Spherical harmonics correlations
### Calculation procedure:
The implemented formula for the real spherical harmonics is the following:
$$
Y_{\ell m} =
\begin{cases}
 \displaystyle (-1)^m\sqrt{2} \sqrt{{2\ell+1 \over 4\pi}{(\ell-|m|)!\over (\ell+|m|)!}} \ 
 P_\ell^{|m|}(\cos \theta) \ \sin( |m|\varphi )  
 &\mbox{if } m<0 
 \\
 \displaystyle \sqrt{{ 2\ell+1 \over 4\pi}} \ P_\ell^m(\cos \theta) 
 & \mbox{if } m=0 
 \\
 \displaystyle (-1)^m\sqrt{2} \sqrt{{2\ell+1 \over 4\pi}{(\ell-m)!\over (\ell+m)!}} \ 
 P_\ell^m(\cos \theta) \ \cos( m\varphi )
 & \mbox{if } m>0 \,.
\end{cases}
$$
Where $\cos \theta$, $\sin \varphi$, $\cos \varphi$ are calculated using cartesian components:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\cos \theta &= \frac{z}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}  \\
\cos \varphi &= \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}  \\ 
\sin \varphi &= \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$
and $\sin |m|\varphi$, $\cos |m|\varphi$ are evaluated using Chebyshev polynomials with a recursive definition:
$$
\begin{cases}
\cos m \varphi &= 2 \cos (m-1)\varphi \cos \varphi - \cos (m-2)\varphi \\
\sin m \varphi &= 2 \cos \varphi \sin (m-1)\varphi - \sin (m-2)\varphi \\
\end{cases}
$$
and $P_\ell^m$ are the associated Legendre polynomials, calculated with the following set of recursive definition:
$$
P_{\ell +1}^{\ell +1}(x) = - (2\ell+1) \sqrt{1-x^2} P_{\ell}^{\ell}(x) \\
P_{\ell +1}^{\ell}(x) = x (2\ell+1) P_{\ell}^{\ell}(x) \\
$$
that allows us to calculate every $(\ell,\ell)$ and every $(\ell,\ell+1)$ element of the $(\ell,m)$ values. Then we have the recursion to go up in $\ell$, for any value of it:
$$
P^m_{\ell} = \frac{x(2\ell - 1)P^m_{\ell-1} - (\ell + m - 1)P^m_{\ell-2}}{\ell - m}
$$

The program, given a number $\ell_{max}$ and a triplet $(x,y,z)$, is able to calculate every value of $Y_{\ell m}(x,y,z) \forall \ell \in [0,\ell_{max}]$ and for all allowed values of $m$ with a single recursion. Let
$$
y_{\ell m}^{I j}(t) = \int_{V_I} \mathrm{d}\theta\mathrm{d}\varphi\mathrm{d}r \rho^j(r,\theta,\varphi,t) Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\varphi)
$$
for some timestep $t$ in some volume $V_I$ taken as a the difference of two concentric spheres centered on the atom $I$ of radius $r_{inner}$ and $r_{outer}$, and where $\rho_j$ is the atomic density of the species $j$. Since the densities are taken as sums of dirac delta functions, it is sufficient to evaluate the spherical harmonics functions at the position of the atoms.
Then we calculate the following:
$$
c_\ell^{Jj}(t)=\langle \frac{1}{N_J}\sum_{I \text{ is of type } J}\sum_{m=-\ell}^{\ell} y_{\ell m}^{I j}(0) y_{\ell m}^{I j}(t) \rangle
$$
where $\langle \cdot \rangle$ is an average operator, and we do an additional average over all the $N_J$ central atoms of the type $J$. The $\langle \cdot \rangle$ average is implemented as an average over the starting timestep.
